# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
Git is a version control manager that lets you keep track of projects as you work on them. GitHub is the User interface that allows us to look at the git through a GUI.

Researched answer:
 GitHub is a platform that allows people to host projects and allows the project to be worked on by other people using Git to clone/push/merge the projects. Git is what allows us as programmers to be able to go back into the different stages of our code veryt easily incase something goes wrong where we have a bug or just simply lose our code from our local machine.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: 
The index of an array is the position that its located inside of that array. The value of the array is the data that is stored inside of that index, which can vary in what kind of datatype it is.

Researched answer:
An index is a location where data is stored. That location is in order sequintaially starting at 0. A value in an array is the content stored in a certain index.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: 
Arrays and string are similar in the fact that they can both hold characters and numbers like :ABCD1234 they are different because arrays are not primitive and strings are. You may have to break down arrays further in order to do the same things that you can do with strings.

Researched answer:
A string is different from an array becasue is holds characters, an array is different because it is a datastructure that holds elements of the same datatypes.
They are both similar that they can both be stored in variables, and can both hold numbers letters or words.

Researched answer: Abstraction , Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

2. Jest: A JS testing framework thath allows us run tests on our code.

3. Objects: Variables that contain many values.
